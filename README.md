# Pathfinding Visualizer  

## Overview  
The **Pathfinding Visualizer** is an interactive web application built with **Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS**, designed to help users understand and visualize pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to place walls, set start and end points, and observe the step-by-step execution of various shortest-path algorithms.  

---

## Algorithms Implemented  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Explores deep paths before backtracking  
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Guarantees the shortest path in a weighted graph  
- **A* Search Algorithm** – An optimized search algorithm using heuristics  

---

## Features  
- **Dynamic Grid System** – Click and drag to place obstacles and set start and end nodes  
- **Algorithm Selection** – Choose different pathfinding algorithms from a dropdown menu  
- **Visual Execution** – Real-time step-by-step visualization of the algorithm's search process  
- **Optimized Animations** – Smooth transitions and visually distinct pathfinding behavior  
- **Reset and Replay** – Easily clear the grid and run new simulations  
- **GitHub Integration** – Direct repository link in the UI for further development and contributions
